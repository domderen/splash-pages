          guide you as you figure out a strategy that will deliver rapid growth
          in the Netherlands and Belgium. Then you'll execute this strategy, driving in-country

        <p className='para'>
          You will work closely with leaders across the company to understand all product,
          engineering and operational requirements, so you'll need to be adept at
          discussing complex situations with a wide variety of audiences. You'll
          feed your market's needs into our development roadmap to ensure we're always
          building the product people want.

          prospective customers from sales to live. You'll handle initial marketing,
          PR, sales, partnerships and account management, and start to build a team
          to support &amp; scale growth in your market.

          One of your first tasks will be to start building your team, hiring someone
          whose strengths complement your own to assist you as you forge a path
