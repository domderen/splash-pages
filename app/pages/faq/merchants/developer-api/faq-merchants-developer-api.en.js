          How does the Partner API work?
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          A Partner integration allows your customers to quickly and easily create a GoCardless account without copying and
          pasting API keys.

          This account will be linked to your Master Merchant account so that you can manage these accounts and process payment
          requests on their behalf.

          Can I host the payment pages on my site?
        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          No - in order to comply with the Direct Debit scheme rules the payment pages are securely hosted on our site.
        </p>
        <p className='para'>
          You can redirect the customer to our payment page and we will redirect them back to your site. Alternatively
          you can allow them to access them via a pop-out from your site.

        </h3>
        <p className='para'>
          No - we do not offer iFraming of our payment pages as we are not sufficiently comfortable with the reliability
          and security of iFrames.

          authorisation of the Direct Debit.

          GoCardless provides webhooks to notify Merchants of any changes in the status of its resources. One extremely
          useful example is determining when a bill has been paid.
